# Archivist Sync

[![CI](https://github.com/camrun91/archivist-sync/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/camrun91/archivist-sync/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Foundry VTT v13 module to connect your world to the Archivist service. It provides a guided setup wizard, an Archivist Hub for managing campaign content, real‑time bidirectional sync for entities and links, and an in‑client "Ask Archivist" sidebar chat with RAG support.

## Features

- **Guided World Setup (Wizard)**: Validate API key, select an Archivist campaign, and import existing Archivist content (Characters, Items, Locations, Factions, and Recaps).
- **Archivist Hub**: A consolidated hub window with tabs for PCs, NPCs, Items, Locations, Factions, and Recaps, including quick open, permission toggle, and a "Sync with Archivist" button.
- **Ask Archivist Chat (Sidebar)**: A streaming RAG chat tab appears in the Foundry sidebar once the world is configured and initialized.
- **Real‑Time Sync (always on)**: GM clients automatically POST/PATCH/DELETE supported entities and links as you create/update/delete them in Foundry.
- **Safe Markdown Handling**: HTML from Foundry is normalized to Markdown for API writes; Markdown from Archivist is converted to sanitized HTML when writing back to Foundry.
- **Journal Sheets & Linking**: Custom journal sheets for Characters (PC/NPC), Items, Locations, Factions, and Recaps with drag‑and‑drop linking between sheets. Links are bidirectionally synchronized with Archivist. Location nesting is supported via parent/child and associative links. GM-only Notes tab on every sheet.

## Installation

### Manual
1. Download this repository.
2. Place it in your Foundry data folder at `Data/modules/archivist-sync/`.
3. Restart Foundry and enable the module in your world’s Module Settings.

### Manifest URL
Use your repository’s release manifest URL (update the placeholder in `module.json`):

`https://github.com/yourusername/archivist-sync/releases/latest/download/module.json`

Tip: Also update the `url`, `manifest`, `download`, and `bugs` fields in `module.json` to point to your repo.

## Getting Started

### 1) Launch World Setup
When you first load a world with the module enabled, the World Setup wizard will launch automatically. You can also launch it manually via Game Settings → Module Settings → Archivist Sync → "Run World Setup Again".

### 2) Run the World Setup wizard
The wizard guides you through:
- API key validation (stored as a world setting, obfuscated in the UI)
- Loading your Archivist campaigns
- Selecting the campaign to link
- Importing existing Archivist content into Foundry (Characters, Items, Locations, Factions, and Recaps)

When you complete setup, the world is marked "initialized", which enables the sidebar chat and activates real-time sync for supported documents.

### 3) Ask Archivist chat (Sidebar)
After initialization, an “Archivist Chat” tab appears in the Foundry sidebar. It streams responses as you type. Chat availability requires all of:
- API key configured
- An Archivist campaign selected
- World initialization completed via the setup wizard

### 4) Archivist Hub
Open the Archivist Hub from Scene Controls or the Journal directory header button. The hub provides:
- Tabs for PCs, NPCs, Items, Locations, Factions, and Recaps
- Quick open and permission toggle for each entry
- "Sync with Archivist" button to reconcile your world:
  - Create any missing Character (PC/NPC), Item, Location, Faction, and Recap sheets
  - Update sheet titles and info when changed in Archivist
  - Reconcile structural Location parent/child via `parent_id`
  - Synchronize sheet‑to‑sheet links to match Archivist Links

### 5) Real‑Time Sync (always active)
The GM client automatically mirrors CRUD events and link changes to Archivist:
- Create/Update/Delete: Characters (PC/NPC), Items, Locations, Factions
- Link/Unlink: Bidirectional link synchronization when dragging sheets or unlinking
- Notes:
  - Runs only for GMs and only when a campaign is selected
  - Images are submitted only if the source is an https URL
  - Recaps are read-only for create/delete operations

## Journal Sheets

The module provides custom journal sheets to organize and link your campaign data:

- **Character**: PC/NPC overview sheet with linked Actor support, character info, and relation tabs (PCs, NPCs, Factions, Items, Locations)
- **Item**: Item summary sheet with linked Item support and relation tabs
- **Entry**: General article/handout with relation tabs
- **Location**: Supports structural nesting (parent_id), ancestor/descendant trees, and associative Location↔Location links
- **Faction**: Dashboard listing related people, entries, locations, and items
- **Recap**: Session summary page bound to an existing Game Session (read-only for create/delete)

All sheets include:
- **GM Notes tab**: Private notes visible only to GMs with rich text editing
- **Drag‑and‑drop linking**: Drop any custom sheet onto another to create bidirectional links
- **Real-time sync**: Link/unlink actions automatically create/delete Link records in Archivist

### Structural vs. associative location links

- **Structural hierarchy**: Uses the Location `parent_id` chain to build parent/child relationships
- **Associative links**: Non‑hierarchical relations between locations for cross‑reference

## Settings Overview

Available in Game Settings → Module Settings → Archivist Sync:

- **API Key** (world): Your Archivist API key (obfuscated in the UI for security)
- **Run World Setup Again** (menu): Reset initialization and relaunch the setup wizard

## API Details

The module communicates with the Archivist API:

- **Base URL**: `https://api.myarchivist.ai/v1`
- **Auth Header**: `x-api-key: <YOUR_API_KEY>`
- **Supported Operations**:
  - Characters, Items, Locations, Factions: CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE
  - Links: CREATE, READ, DELETE (bidirectional sync between sheets)
  - Sessions (Recaps): READ, UPDATE (title/summary only; no create/delete)
  - Ask (RAG Chat): POST to `/ask` with streaming support

Examples (representative; bodies vary by type):

```json
// Create Character
{
  "character_name": "Elowen",
  "description": "...markdown...",
  "image": "https://...",
  "campaign_id": "<id>"
}
```

```json
// Ask (RAG chat)
{
  "campaign_id": "<id>",
  "messages": [
    { "role": "user", "content": "Who is the duke?" }
  ],
  "stream": true
}
```

## Compatibility

- **Foundry VTT**: v13 (minimum 13.341; verified 13.346)
- **Game Systems**: System-agnostic with built-in adapters for common systems

## Security & Permissions

- The API key is stored as a world-scoped setting and obfuscated in the UI.
- Real‑Time Sync and the "Sync with Archivist" button execute only on GM clients.
- The sidebar chat is available to all users once the world is configured and initialized.
- All requests use HTTPS endpoints with CORS-safe headers and exponential backoff on `429` and network failures.

## Troubleshooting

- “Chat not available”: Ensure API key is set, a campaign is selected, and the world has been initialized via the setup wizard.
- “Rate limited (429)”: The module automatically retries with exponential backoff and jitter; wait and retry if necessary.
- “CORS error”: Your server must allow browser requests from your Foundry origin for API routes.
- “Images missing”: Only https image URLs are sent to Archivist; local file paths are ignored for API writes.

## Development

### Setup

1. Install Node.js 18.x or 20.x (or use `.nvmrc` with `nvm use`)
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`

### Code Quality

This project uses ESLint and Prettier for code quality and formatting:

```bash
# Check for linting issues
npm run lint

# Auto-fix formatting issues
npm run lint:fix
```

### Continuous Integration

GitHub Actions automatically runs on all pushes and pull requests:
- **Linting**: Checks code style and catches common errors
- **Validation**: Ensures module.json is valid and required files exist

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details.
