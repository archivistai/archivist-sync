## [1.3.4] - 2025-10-21

### Changed
- Recaps Journal folder entries are now sorted chronologically

## [1.3.3] - 2025-10-21

### Added
- If the counts for documents being imported into Archivist during the initial world setup exceed 100 for any of the categories, we format those values in red and display a conditional warning to users not to import generic compendium items into their Archivist campaigns.

### Changed
- Moved visibility toggle icon buttons to in-line actions for list items in Journals tab
- Replaced "Archivist Hub" button in Journals tab with "Sync with Archivist" button
- We no longer overwrite the `img` property of existing Actors/Items if they are mapped to an Archivist record during initial sync. We'll only set that property if we're creating a new object for the user and we have a non-null Archivist `image` value.

### Removed
- Archivist Hub Dialog
- Archivist Hub Scene controls button
- Archivist Hub buttons in Journal tab and Archivist chat tab
